Simple Web3 Voting App: Full Stack Project with Flutter Frontend
This is a basic decentralized voting application (DApp) using blockchain for transparency.
Users connect a wallet, view candidates, cast a vote (one per wallet address), and see real-time vote counts. 
It's "full stack" with:

Frontend: Flutter mobile app.
Backend: Solidity smart contract on Ethereum (deployed to a Sepolia testnet).
Web3 Integration: Uses web3dart for contract interaction and WalletConnect (via web3modal_flutter) for this mobile wallet connection (e.g., MetaMask mobile).
